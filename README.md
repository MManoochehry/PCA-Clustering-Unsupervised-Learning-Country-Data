In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing various socio-economic indicators of counties. After thorough preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, I applied PCA to reduce dimensionality and gain insights into feature importance. Utilizing clustering techniques, I grouped countries based on their economic characteristics. The aim was to identify regions in need of financial aid by focusing on clusters with lower GDP per capita, higher child mortality rates, and lower healthcare expenditure. This analysis provides a valuable understanding of the counties' financial and developmental status, aiding in the prioritization of assistance to improve living conditions and economic growth.
